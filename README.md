# dice-chance

This is a dice rolling and analysis library. The goal is to accept a dice rolling formula and calculate the probability distribution.

## Roadmap

These are the dice rolling formulas that will be supported through versions:

### v1

This version aims to support the very simple use case: roll a die with `x` sides `y` times. Accepted formula looks like `2d6`: rolling 6-side die 2 times.

### v2

This version aims to support modifiers on top of previous version. Accepted formula looks like `2d6 + 3`.

### v3

This version aims to support multiple dices of different number of sides. Accepted formula looks like `2d6 + 1d10 + 3`.

### v4+

Priority for future versions are undetermined.
